# Foster-APP
Group Project for ICS-499


This was a group project spanning a semester of college. We had to pick a real need from an employer of one of the group members or a business we knew. One of the group members worked for Hennepin county foster care system and still used mail/phone/physical system to keep track and manage foster care kids. We aimed to make a user faced portal that you could use to manage foster children. It was a three layered app with a customer section, admin section and database integration and management. 

Along with creating the code, interacting pages and components we used a new framework to all of us - VueJS.
We had to present reports at multiple intervals along the way with working sequence diagrams, code and a working and functional wip application.
